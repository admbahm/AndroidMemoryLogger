# Go Android Memory Logger

A lightweight Go utility to continuously log memory usage from a connected Android device.  
This tool is designed to run alongside automated tests (like UIAutomator) to help developers correlate specific user actions with their impact on application and system memory.

The output is a simple, timestamped **CSV file**, perfect for graphing and analysis.

## üöÄ Key Features
- **Continuous Polling**: Gathers memory snapshots at a configurable interval.  
- **Detailed Metrics**: Captures key memory indicators, including an app's Total PSS, Java Heap, and the system's available RAM.  
- **CSV Output**: Generates a universally compatible `memory_log_go.csv` file, ready for import into Excel, Google Sheets, or any data analysis tool.  
- **Minimal Performance Impact**: Uses the native Android `dumpsys` tool, ensuring the measurement process has a negligible effect on device performance.  
- **Ideal for Automated UI Testing**: Designed to run in the background to provide a clear performance log for a full UI test suite.

## üìã Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed and configured:

- **Go**: Version 1.18 or later  
- **Android SDK Platform-Tools**: `adb` must be available in your system‚Äôs `PATH`  
- **A Connected Android Device**: With **USB Debugging enabled**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

1. **Place the Code**: Save the Go program into a file named `main.go`.  
2. **Initialize Go Module**: From the same directory as `main.go`, run:

   ```bash
   go mod init adb-memlogger
   ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

### Basic Execution

1. **Configure the Logger**: Open `main.go` and modify the constants:

   ```go
   const (
       // The package name of the app you want to monitor
       packageName  = "com.your.package.name"
       // How many seconds to wait between each poll
       pollInterval = 5 * time.Second
   )
   ```

2. **Run the Program**: With your device connected, run:

   ```bash
   go run .
   ```

   The program will start logging memory data to `memory_log_go.csv` in the same directory.  
   Press `Ctrl+C` to stop.

### üîó Integrating with UIAutomator Tests

This is the primary use case: capture memory data for the exact duration of your test run.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "‚úÖ Starting memory logger in the background..."

# Start the Go logger and send it to the background
go run . &

# Save the Process ID (PID) of the logger
LOGGER_PID=$!

echo "‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running UIAutomator test suite..."

# Execute your UI test command (replace with your actual command)
adb shell am instrument -w com.example.myapp.test/androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner

echo "‚èπÔ∏è UI tests finished. Stopping memory logger..."

# Stop the background logger using its PID
kill $LOGGER_PID

echo "üìä Memory log saved to memory_log_go.csv. Analysis complete."
```

## üìÇ Output File

The script generates a CSV file with the following columns:

```
Timestamp, PSS_Total_kB, Java_Heap_kB, System_Free_RAM_kB
2025-08-25 22:10:53, 154321, 65536, 2345678
2025-08-25 22:10:58, 158910, 71234, 2310987
...
```

You can easily graph this data to visualize memory usage during your tests.

## üîÆ Future Enhancements (TODO)

- [ ] Implement command-line flags to specify package name and poll interval at runtime  
- [ ] Create a master shell script (`run_test.sh`) to automate the entire process  
- [ ] Add CPU usage monitoring by parsing `dumpsys cpuinfo`  
- [ ] Add support for targeting a specific device by serial number if multiple devices are connected
